Noobee, a studentâ€™s personal robot, was motivated by a desire to explore a more human side of robotics.  Noobees uses 3-wire I2C to communicates using text characters, so that classroom robots can communicate with their peer robots, in either human or computer language, through inexpensive cables and without the cost, size, and supply current burdens required by Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

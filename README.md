# The Nexus Project
<b>Advanced Computing Platforms</b> are student-designed computer systems each providing two interconnected system boards rather than one. Each is designed to provide solutions within a specific domain. The two system boards operate as one, providing a uniform user experience on a single monitor, while providing functionality not possible with a single system board.</p> 
<b>The Nexus Project</b> defines an affordable dual-processor Advanced Computer Platform (ACP) built into a portable magnetic whiteboard.  It supports both AI and a new class of magnetic classroom manipulatives grounded in recent brain research.  Nexus, like all ACPs, runs either Windows or Linux operating systems.  It can be operated without a separate monitor, keyboard, or mouse.  Using VNC technology, its display and input devices can be almost any network-capable device, including Chromebook, mobile platforms, laptops, and other PCs.

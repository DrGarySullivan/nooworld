Noobee, a studentâ€™s personal robot, was motivated by a desire to explore a more human side of robotics.  Noobees use 3-wire I2C to communicate using text characters, so that classroom robots can communicate with their peer robots, in either human or computer language, through inexpensive cables and without the cost, size, and supply current burdens required by Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

By using the I2C interface to send ordinary written messages, students coding Noobee can explore their own interpersonal communication in a very creative fashion. And they can program the robot with a coding language created by educators or even the students themselves.

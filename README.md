# The Nexus Project
Advanced Computing Platforms are student-designed computer systems each providing sporting two interconnected system boards rather than one. Each is designed to provide solutions within a specific domain. The two system boards operate as one, providing a uniform user experience on a single monitor, while providing functionality not possible with a single system board./p 
Nexus is an affordable dual-processor Advanced Computer Platform (ACP) built into a portable magnetic whiteboard.  It is designed to support both AI and a new class of magnetic classroom manipulatives grounded in recent brain research.  See our solutions gallery for examples./p 
Nexus, like all ACPs, runs either Windows or Linux operating systems.  It can be operated without a separate monitor, keyboard, or mouse.  Using VNC technology, its display and input devices can be almost any network-capable device, including Chromebook, mobile platforms, laptops, and other PCs.
